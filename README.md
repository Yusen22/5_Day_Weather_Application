## Usage

To begin using the application, start typing the name of a chosen city into the search box in the top-left of the application. As the input is entered, a number of autocomplete list items will appear under the search box, displaying the typed city name exactly with an additional country code.

If a 'timeblock' is saved with no content, an alert will occur and no action will be taken. 


Each 'timeblock's' colour is dynamically updated within the app according to whether it is in the past in the current workday, it is the current hour, or it is in the future. The colour key for this feature is: 
 
                - PAST = Grey
                - PRESENT = Red
                - FUTURE = Green 

You will be able to enter tasks in any 'timeblock' regardless of it's current colour. 


To clear all tasks permanently, locate the 'Clear All Tasks' button at the bottom of the application's page. Click the button, and then click 'OK' in the confirm alert message that appears on screen. All tasks will now be deleted, and new entries will need to be made for content to appear in the 'timeblocks'.

Click 'Cancel' when asked to confirm deletion of all entries to return to the application with no action taken
